- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Output <tt>announcement</tt> alongside the formatted output. This is an alternative to using Kernel#puts - it will display nicer, and in all outputs (in case you use several formatters)
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Beware that the output will be printed <b>before</b> the corresponding step. This is because the step itself will not be printed until after it has run, so it can be coloured according to its status.
